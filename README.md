## Hi there üëã

- ‚òÄÔ∏è This profile showcases an array of personal code projects I have created in my free time Ô∏è.
- üí¨ <ins><b>Academic projects are not included</b></ins> but I am happy to answer questions about them. <br>&emsp; <i>Their topic areas include convolutional neural networks, computer vision, multi-cloud applications and novel view synthesis. </i>

The table below showcases key projects I have designed and created. All projects can be found [here](https://github.com/StevenButtifint?tab=repositories).
