## Hi there, I'm Steven ðŸ‘‹

This profile serves as an archive for a range of code projects I have created in my free time. <br>
Independent academic research and development projects are not included.
Their topic areas include convolutional neural networks, multi-cloud applications and novel view synthesis.
I am happy to answer questions about them. 

The table below showcases some key projects I have created. All projects can be found [here](https://github.com/StevenButtifint?tab=repositories).

| The application consists of a range of tools that are designed for users with dyslexia. The tools assist the user when completing other reading or writing tasks. The application was created using Python with Tkinter for the GUI. |

| This game was made using Python, Tkinter GUI toolkit and Google Sheets API. It consists of offline and online game modes. There are many customization options such as card design, window resolution, bot count, bot playstyle and starting round size. |

| This interactive sandbox visualizer was made in Java using the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). Visually compare different search algorithms in a sandbox grid. Place walls and checkpoints to make the route task unique and watch the different algorithms go about finding their solutions. |
